		better, they no longer reset back to original position, but they still jump too far
		- incorrect - resize still definitely resets back to original position
		- and on resume jumps waay too far. 

		the delta Y and X are not scaled?

	on resume after pause and resize, particles jump position incorrectly or completely dissappear
